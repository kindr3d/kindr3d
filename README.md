### This is our attempt to create a place for people like us and learn a thing or two

## Ideas
* ~~learn some hardware by hosting and dockerising the server side ourselves (strikethrough)~~
* ~~use React, Node.js, Jest, Express to create a bookclub/skillsharing/support network~~
* setup our own testing suit (TravisCI)
* document everything we do and write posts about it to help other learners
* accessibility
* TDD


## TODO
- [x] agree on the concept, sketch architecture and MVP
- [ ] setup priorities for Micaela and Elvina
- [ ] setup linting rules and style preferences
- [ ] figure out if we use branching or work in the master

## MVP
Tool to create subreddit like study or reading groups with posts sorted chronologically that users can comment on. Comments are sorted by up/downvotes.
Basic things MVP has to do:
* register/login/edit/delete user
* create/delete/edit/join/leave a group
* add/edit/delete a posts
* write/delete/edit a comment for a post
* upvote or downvote a comment

## STACK
* Node.js
* Express
* heroku
* postgres?
* http2
* Jest
* grid/flexbox

## SCHEDULE
- [x] 1 week(30.07.17): talked about concept/stack/design
- [ ] 2 week: setup a server and heroku
- [ ] 3 week: database
