### This is our attempt to create a place for people like us and learn a thing or two

## Ideas
* learn some hardware by hosting and dockerising the server side ourselves
* use React, Node.js, Jest, Express to create a bookclub/skillsharing/support network
* setup our own testing suit (TravisCI)
* Document everything we do and write posts about it to help other learners
